An x86 (IA-32) system kernel for educational purposes.

The goals of this kernel project are:
1) To be heavily documented/commented so that everything is clear
2) To be internally understandable
3) To be functional as much possible
4) To use the simplest of means to achieve certain functions
5) To be suitable for an introductory computer science / software-engineering course in computer architecture and/or operating systems.
6) To attract people into the low-level/kernel development world

These are not the goals of this project/kernel:
1) To be secure
2) To be performant
3) To be extensible
4) To be in any other way useful for non-recreational purposes
